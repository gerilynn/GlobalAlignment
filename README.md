# GlobalAlignment
dynamic programming algorithm to calculate optimal alignment between two strings

INPUT: 
args[0] = match score; 
args[1] = mismatch score; 
args[2] = indel score;
args[3] = filename.txt (in fasta file format)

OUTPUT:
Alignment matrix with alignment scores. 
Optimal alignment strings.
